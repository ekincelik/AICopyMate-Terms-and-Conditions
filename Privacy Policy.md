# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: [2025-06-04]_

This Privacy Policy outlines how your data is handled when using this AI wrapper app (the “App”).

## 1. Data Collection

This App does **not** collect or store any personal data on its own servers.

However, in order to function, the App sends user input to third-party AI services (e.g., OpenAI) for processing. These services may log or store data as part of their own operations.

## 2. Use of Input Data

When you use the App:

- Your input is sent to the third-party AI API for generating responses.
- The App does not store or analyze your input or the generated output locally or remotely.

**Please avoid entering any sensitive, private, or personally identifiable information.**

## 3. Third-Party Services

This App relies on third-party AI platforms. By using the App, you also agree to their privacy policies. For example:

- [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy)

These providers may retain request data to monitor abuse or improve their services, according to their terms.

## 4. Analytics (If Applicable)

If analytics tools (such as Firebase or similar) are integrated in future versions, they will be used solely for crash reporting or usage statistics — not for tracking individual users.

Any such changes will be reflected in an updated version of this Privacy Policy.

## 5. Your Responsibility

You are responsible for:

- Understanding the nature of AI-generated content.
- Ensuring that your use of the App complies with any data protection or privacy regulations that apply in your jurisdiction.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. The latest version will always be available in this GitHub repository.
